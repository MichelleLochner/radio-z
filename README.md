# Radio-z 
## Bayesian HI spectral line fitting code

`radio-z` is a package to implement the technique outlined in paper <paper reference>. If you use any of the code in this repository, please cite the original paper.

Installation is easiest using [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and using the `environment.yml` file to set up a dedicated anaconda environment. 
Otherwise ensure the requirements listed in `environment.yml` are installed and install `radio-z` using:

`python setup.py install`

You can test the installation using the example notebook in the `examples` folder. 

While much of the code is dedicated to reading in and working with SKA simulated data, the core `hifit.py` code could be adapted for general spectral line fitting.

Please feel free to contact us via the issues, or the email addresses in the paper.
